      <p>
        Civil Engineers innovate, create and renovate, keeping the constructed
        infrastructure facilities up and functioning at all times, responsible
        for flourishing civilizations throughout history. The situation is no
        different in modern times with them responsible for the efficient upkeep
        of the society. However, the mounting concerns towards environmental
        degradation due to develop- mental activities have led to the limelight
        falling on Sustainable Practices. Sustainability by definition is the
        method of using resource in a way that the resource is not depleted or
        permanently damaged. Despite the concept being as old as history, it has
        gained prominence in recent times. The American Society of Civil
        Engineers (ASCE) defines sustainability as a set of economic,
        environmental and social conditions in which all of society has the
        capacity and opportunity to maintain and improve its quality of life
        without degrading the quantity, quality or the availability of economic,
        environmental and social resources. Sustainable development is the
        application of these resources to enhance the safety, welfare, and
        quality of life for all of society. Practicing Civil Engineers, who are
        in control of all things from A to Z for a thriving human civilization,
        need to be responsible towards the economy, environment and society.
        This conference, SPICE 2026, thus, aims to be a platform for all
        stakeholders concerned to present, discuss, cooperate, redefine and
        innovate sustainable solutions for the continuance of the human
        civilization to higher levels of sophistication and technological
        advancement while still being nurtured in the cradle of nature and to
        address all the possible sustainable development goals.
